iOS TODO application
--------------------

This application demonstrates the functionality offered by [AeroGear](http://aerogear.org) library for iOS.
It connects to the [TODO server application](https://todoauth-aerogear.rhcloud.com) running in Openshift, and it will allow you to perform CRUD operations
for Projects/Tags/Tasks using you phone. 

You can watch a screencast demonstrating the app "in action" [here](https://vimeo.com/50829021)

If you are new to AeroGear, please have a look at the [Getting Started Guide with XCode and iOS](http://aerogear.org/docs/guides/GetStartedwithAeroGearandXcode/)

## Running the app:

The project requires [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) for dependency management;

### SETUP

_BEFORE_ you can run the app, you need to run the following command inside of the AeroGear-TODO folder:

    pod install

Now you are almost done! You just need to open the AeroGear-TODO.xcworkspace in order to run the TODO app!

Enjoy!
